# reactWebpackPractice001
Practices done while following Tyler McGinnis' react and webpack tutorials

# Some info
- Use "--config flag" to specify webpack configs to compile interested pratices.
- All practices use html-webpack-plugin, handlebar template used is name "index.html" located the "app" folder.
- Although I used the syntax for multiple entry points, only one is actually passed in, it was done that way so the "[name]" variable is defined for use for the output filename field.
